# Pods

A pod is the smallest unit of work in k8s

A node can run many pods and a pod can run one or more containers.
If a pod runs more that one container, there is usually a master container where the application logic is located.
The others are helper containers that provides services to the main one.

Let’s first create a node running Nginx by using the imperative way.

## Create the pod

    kubectl run mynginx --image=nginx

## Get a list of running pods

    kubectl get pods

## Get more info

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    kubectl describe pod mynginx

## Delete the pod

    kubectl delete pod mynginx

## Create a pod running BusyBox

Let’s now create a node running BusyBox, this time attaching bash to our terminal.

    kubectl run mybox --image=busybox -it -- /bin/sh

## List the folders and use command

    ls
    echo -n 'A Secret' | base64
    exit

## Cleanup

    kubectl delete pod mybox

## Create a pod using the declarative way

Let’s now create a node using a YAML file.

    kubectl create -f myapp.yaml

## Get some info

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    kubectl describe pod myapp-pod

## Attach our terminal

    kubectl exec -it myapp-pod -- bash

Print the DBCON environment variable that was set in the YAML file.

    echo $DBCON

## Detach from the instance

    exit

## Cleanup

    kubectl delete -f myapp.yaml
